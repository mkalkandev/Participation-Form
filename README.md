Continued development
This was my second form project with HTML and CSS and I am more satisfied with the result than the previous one. This time I tried to learn new things, so I tried to structure the HTML better, it was my first attempt at semantic tags. It's not bad, although it's still not what I wanted. I'll keep going.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
